        <td>020 7332 3322</td>
        <td>Hampstead Heath is a wild park of woodland and meadows, tucked inside north London’s Zone Two - less than four miles from the centre, though you’d never know it. It sprawls over 800 acres and boasts some of the most spectacular views in the city. This is the park that inspired C.S. Lewis to write The Chronicles of Narnia, that Constable spent his final years painting, and Londoners of all stripes have been coming here to escape the city for over 200 years.
            Today, there are few better ways to spend a Sunday in London than with a lazy ramble on the Heath, followed by a pint, or a roast, at one of our wonderful local pubs. The swimming ponds - particularly the ladies’ and men’s - hold almost mystical status among those brave enough to take a dip. Come to fly your kite on Parliament Hill, bring a picnic, and while away your afternoon.</td>

        <td>One of London's 'Magnificent Seven' cemeteries, privately ran and opened to burials in 1841. Burials ceased in 1966, whereby the site was closed as a Cemetery by Act of Parliament and re-declared a Park. The Park was owned and managed by the Greater London Council (GLC) until 1985. With the abolition of the GLC, it passed to the London Borough of Tower Hamlets.

            The Park is within a conservation area, contains several English Heritage Grade 2 listed monuments, is a site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation. In 2001, the Park and Ackroyd Drive together became the borough's first Local Nature Reserve. The 'Friends' patron, David Bellamy, was present at the declaration ceremony.
            
            The site has a varied network of paths that take you on a tour around wonderful woodlands taking in unique and special wildflower meadows. On your tour, you will see many birds, butterflies, and plants uncommonly seen in London.
            
            The park actively takes part in grave research, and if you want to get in touch regarding tracing relatives or information, please get in touch using the details below. Alternatively, get in touch if you want to get involved volunteering with grave research.

            Soho Square dates back to the 1680s in an area of land known previously as Soho fields.
            
            The half-timbered black and white building in the centre, which was built in 1895, was refurbished in 2009.
            
            The site contains a statue of Charles II. It is recorded that in the 1790s the Garden was planted with Almond, Peach, Cherry, Lilac, Roses, Laburnum, and Honeysuckle. Today the gardens provide a green oasis in the densely built-up West End.</td>
